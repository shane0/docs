# mkdocs

I usually use [mkdocs material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

recently built deployed this one: <https://shane0.github.io>

as I was experimenting with chatgpt

anyway, I'm comparing docusaurus to mkdocs as a possible replacment

so far, mkdocs has a lot to offer

but with some feature building and pipelines it might become useful
